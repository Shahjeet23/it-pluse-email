## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light desaturated blue (#ADD8E6). This color is reminiscent of professional services, reliability, and the youthful energy described in the ad copy.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF).  A light background helps to present information clearly.
- Accent color: Pale green (#BCF5A9) to draw attention to interactive elements and CTAs, such as 'submit.'
- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a contemporary, precise feel.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif), giving body text a modern, objective look. Use 'Poppins' for headlines and 'PT Sans' for body.
- Simple, clean icons to represent form fields (e.g., a user icon for name, a calendar icon for age).
- A clean, single-column layout to focus attention on the video and the form. The form should be prominently displayed, possibly with a soft shadow to lift it from the background.
- Subtle transition animations on form elements, especially when the form is submitted.
